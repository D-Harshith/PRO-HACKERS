# Vehicle-speed-detection
In the project simulate the tracker.py first then simulate the SpeedDetector.py. Finally, a new window pops up and the output video will be played with vehicles in normal speed in green box and vehicles exceeding the speed limit(60kmph) in red box.
Our model assigns a ID to each vehicle, and creates a SpeedRecord text file which records ID and SPEED of all vehicles, and if any vehicle exceeds the speed limit it will be marked as exceeded and finally in the summary all the vehicles which exceeded the speed will be counted. 
Images of all vehicles will be stored in a folder. If we get access to numberplate registration database we can send message to corresponding vehicle owner using Tequlia in python.
The speed limit can be changed according to road.
